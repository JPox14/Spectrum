Code and data for Palmer Foster 2022

Regarding the primary model, data files are .mat, while code is .m.  

For each instance of running code, ensure your directory contains all functions required in the main script. 

steadystateNutEx, LVfunc_EX, and LVfunc_Ex_NoDeg are the only functions required to run with the primary scripts. 

If running code to recreate a PIP from the paper, make sure you are use all 3 parts of the code.  First run Part 1, then Part 2, and finally Part 3.  Part 1 is by far the most time consuming.  However, I found it to be good practice to save the data from part 1, then examine the data from part 2, before proceeding to part 3.  

All plots shown in the paper are generated by the scripts written in this repository.  In some instances, adobe illustrator was used to clarify data (i.e. when two variables followed identical trajectories, I manually offset the lines in illustrator, though made sure to always keep them in contact with one another. 

For the statistical models, the two main scrips are BinaryPGLMM.R and MCMCglmm.R.  They are annotated to make it clear which data files correspond to which script. 

Please contact me via email with any enquiries and I will happily assist.  Thank you for reading and your interest in my work.
